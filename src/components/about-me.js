        <p>I am an accomplished accounting contractor, and I enjoy using my skills to help various accounting departments advance their processes and procedures through VBA Macros. I graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2020 with a masterâ€™s in accounting. While attending school and working for Coca-Cola, I became drawn towards VBA scripts. This burning interest led me to want to know more about scripting languages. So, I enrolled in a Full-stack development bootcamp at Georgia Institute of Technology. My goal is to garnish a better understand of scripting languages and utilize this knowledge within my career.</p>
